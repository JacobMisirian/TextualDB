# TextualDB
Text Based Database in C#

## Premise

The main premise behind TextualDB is to have a database with similar controls and methodology to
a traditional SQL-esque program while maintaining an easily editable ASCII based format that can
be modified with any common text editor.

Each 'database' is a text file that can contain an unlimited amount of tables. A table can have
an unlimited amount of columns and each row will have a string that represents the value for
that column (default is an empty string).
